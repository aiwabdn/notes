* Neural Networks as universal function approximators [[http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html][source]]
** Neural Networks can approximate any function to arbitrary precision
 - For any given function, there is guaranteed to be a neural network that, for any given *x*, can output _f_(*x*) or a close approximation to it
 - It holds for all *smooth* functions with arbitrary number of inputs and outputs
